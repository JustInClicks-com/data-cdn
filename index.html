						 Here’s summary of points on why QRS is by far the world’s best PEMF system
						 </p>
					 </div>
					 <ol style="color:#191970;font-weight:400">
						 <li>
							 How was it developed?   QRS is the original system developed by world renowned inventor Dr EG Fischer working with the prestigious team of leading scientists.  This included  Dr. Linus Pauling considered the father of Vitamin C and Ortho Molecular Medicine  and recipient of (2) Nobel Peace prizes.  Also Dr Robert O Becker considered the father of electrotherapy and electrochemically induced cellular regeneration. Dr Becker leading the early opposition to high voltage power lines and was named one of the most influential figures in the area of anti EMF activism.

						 </li>
						 <li>
							 QRS has (4) world Patents on their technology and continue to improve it with proprietary developments to this day. The other competitors tried to use this proven technology but were forced to stop. So since they can’t use the proven patented technology, their mats instead rely on inferior unpatented, unproven substitutes.

						 </li>
						 <li>
							 QRS has far more research than any other PEMF system with over 200 papers and clinical studies published.

						 </li>
						 <li>
							 One of the most significant points is the QRS is the only PEMF systems that absorbs harmful electro smog (EMF’s) and they have the patent that protects this critical technical capability.  You can find some videos on the internet showing that the IMRS and the Bemer created 30 to 60 times more electrosmog than the QRS, which registers at 0.  This is critical.   Think of it.  Would you sleep with your head resting on your cell phone?

						 </li>
						 <li>
							 QRS is designed to sleep on as it utilizes a soft and plush mesh fiber system.  iMRS don’t have the patent to resort to a hard copper coil system.

						 </li>
						 <li>
							 QRS has an ear device accessory which helps with Tinnitus and other hearing problems.  It also has Treatment Goggles which help many eye conditions including Macular degeneration and  Glaucoma.  iMRS, in contrast, has a, what they call, brain entertainment light and music show that they have the nerve to sell for $700.

						 </li>
						 <li>
								Exclusvie patented bioavailable wave form signal that is an identical match to nature. They us a proprietary Double Sawtooth QRS e-Function Signal – The proprietary softly curled QRS e-Function Signal is different than the other brands. And it’s NOT something that can be easily produced such as the inferior, jolted energy Square Wave that’s used in the MRS and Other Systems.

						 </li>
						 <li>
							 QRS works so well QRS offers you a 1 month return privilege.  You have no risk.  No other systems offers anything close to this.  IMRS offers only 15 days. Could there be something they’re afraid of?

						 </li>

								 <p>Patent 1 - Protection from Interfering Fields</p>
							 </div><br>
							 <ul style="color:#191970;">
								 <li>
									 Wherever there are electrical cables in the air, earth or buildings, electrosmog exists. This can cause so-called energy diseases, which in turn can cause chronic diseases.

								 </li>
								 <li>
									 While infectious diseases decreased more and more during the last I00 years, chronic disease rose rapidly (also due to energy deficits).

								 </li>
								 <li>
									 The healing frequencies of natural magnetic fields do not stand a chance against the electrosmog fields, the self-healing processes of the body are blocked.

								 </li>
								 <li>The quantronic therapy system intervenes by supplying the body again with vital energy.</li>
								 <li>
									 Such artificially generated healing magnetic fields only have an effect if a reduced EMF field was generated in the room first.

								 </li>
								 <li>
									 This means that the existing electrosmog has to be reduced to a minimum. Because if therapeutic frequencies are mixed with the electrosmog they have a far from healing effect.

								 </li>
								 <li>
									 QRS is the only manufacturer who considers this and has internationally patented the “50 HZ electrosmog killer" in connection with quantronic therapy.

								 <p>Patent 2 - Ion Transport Device for Transport of Ions Especially Protons</p>
							 </div>
							 <br>
							 <ul style="color:#191970;">
								 <li> All magnetic field therapy manufacturers generally claim that their products regenerate cells, heal diseases and energize cells by activating the cell metabolism. Cell metabolism however is always conditional on ion transport.
									</li>
								 <li>
									 Therefore be prudent with such statements: Only QRS after many years of research has the worldwide patent for ion transport in the body cells. If anyone claims this ability, the statement is either wrong or is infringing on the worldwide QRS patent.

								 </li>
								 <li>
									 Because of that, better cell supply is possible and at the same time cells are freed from waste products and toxins.
								 </li>
								 <li>
									 QRS provides a marked increase of oxygen in the tissues; the rate of oxygen diffusion is raised by 80-900% and energy molecules (ATP) are formed.

						 <p>Patent 3 - Resonance Phenomenon</p>
					 </div>
					 <br>
					 <ul style="color:#191970;">
						 <li>
							 In order to support the cell metabolism. as well as releasing the cells of toxins, free radicals and waste products the tension of the cell membrane has to be maintained at a high level. To slow down the cell aging at the same, the energy part of the cell has to be built up. Only then energy molecules (ATP) will be formed.

						 </li>
							 <li>
								 This only works with the cell specific amplitude window. This window in the body cell was discovered by QRS and it makes the Ion transport possible and therefore the so-called resonance phenomenon.

							 </li>
							 <li>
								 Only in this way a resonance can be produced in ions, cell membranes and the walls of blood vessels. And only when this resonance is produced can ions be transported and the cell metabolism is beneficially influenced.

							 </li>
							 <li>
								 How this actually works as with QRS, it strengthens the immune system as well as regeneration of the body through production of protein (in the case of nerve cells; memory proteins), build-up and balancing of the bio-electro-potential of cell energy, strengthening of the metabolism and activation of hormone production.

							 </li>
							 <li>
								 The patent was issued for these phenomenons which are the sole preconditions for the energy build-up in the cell.

							 </li>
							 <li>
								 The QRS applies controlled electromagnetic fields (resonance), adapted to the organism, to the body and this achieves:

							 </li>
								 <li>
										A completely deep action as in every part of the organism fields and currents are formed, even in the blood vessels, where until now only pharmaceuticals could effect the necessary regulation.
								 </li>
									 <li>
										 A strengthening of the body's own weakened fields, to steady and stabilize bones, for the exchange of cell nutrients and waste products, for the formation of proteins, to regenerate cell components and to boost the immune system.

									 </li>
							 <li>
								 A harmonization of uncoupled oscillators to balance tension and relation in the autonomic nervous system, to gently dilate tense blood vessels, to initiate sleeping rhythms and automatically initiate the performance phase in the morning.

							 </li>
							 <li>
									Most medications, which spontaneously cover the symptoms of disease, often have unforeseeable side effects. The QRS however, supports the natural healing capacity of an organism and helps to fight the causes of disease without the side effects. Of course therapy with the QRS is quicker and more successful if it is supported by proper nutrition and the necessary exercise.

						 <p>The Key-Lock Principle is the Bioelectric <br>QRS Master Key to the Cell Membrane</p>
						</div>
						</center>
						<br>
						<div class="row" style="color:white;">
						 <div class="col-md-6">
							 <p>The QRS System activates cells for better absorption of vital substances including oxygen. The daily use of the QRS vitalizes the organism in a specific ways, which, for example, can only be reached by taking a daily walk for more than three hours.
								</p><br>
							 <p>In detail: The QRS increases cell metabolism and therefore improves the cell membrane potential. This improves the cell's ability to function. The improved electric cell voltage provides a higher "osmotic" pull for the absorption of minerals and nutrients into the cell. At the same time the circulation of the blood in the tissues is increased providing thirsty cells with more oxygen.
							 </p><br>
							<p>A higher blood and oxygen penetration provides further positive effects: reduction of fermentation processes and acid excesses, relaxation of tensed hardened muscles, boosting metabolism and strengthening the immune system. Additionally QRS works in a purifying way, promoting the removal of toxic agents out of the cells.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								When hormones cause muscle growth, there is no effort behind it, but in a simple and ingenious principle of nature: hormones function exclusively as  signaling substances, which transport messages. But the cell will accept the message only if the "feelers" of the hormone fit perfectly into the docking station of the cell, the cell "receptors". This mechanism is called the "key-lock principle".
							</p><br>
						 </div>
						 <div class="col-md-6">
							 <p>
								 In the meantime science has found out that a cell not only transforms the "secret codes" of the hormones into a biologic language but also turns on special "electromagnetic receptors", which react by means of quantum resonance fields.
							 </p><br>
							 <p>
								 Quantum fields have the particular characteristic that they gently pass through the body without resistance, in contrast to light, sound and electric frequencies, which are already absorbed in the upper skin layers.
							 </p><br>
							 <p>
								 QRS has imitated this principle of nature in an ingenious way. The QRS frequencies latch into the receptor as a frequency message, a code. Then the body's own biological language the messages: "cells work, cells produce energy, cells clean up - are received by the cell effectively!"

						 <p>Only QRS has Fibonacci in this PEMF <br>Patented Technology</p>
					 </div>
					 <div class="row" style="color:#191970;">
						 <div class="col-md-6">
								 <p>
									The QRS e-function (exponential) waveform is a soft-curl Fibonacci shape at the top of each power pulse being emitted with a soft dissipation of the energy, slowly removing the power at first, and then it lets go, faster and faster, in an exponential spin until it hits infinite speed of release.
								 </p><br>
								<p>This e-function waveform only works with the cell specific amplitude window and is the secret to the unlocking principle in the cell walls to begin the osmotic ionic transfer of nutrients - in and flush of the waste - out.
								</p><br>
								<p>
									This is called the “Resonance Phenomenon” that initiates the “Ion Transport.” QRS has two worldwide patents in relation to this.
								</p><br>
								<p>
									This group of frequencies that make up a QRS e-function waveform satisfies all the frequencies of the body cells from 0.1 hertz to 1,000 hertz, but do not contain the frequencies in the range of 50 to 60 hertz which is protection from interfering EMF fields (electrosmog). This is an additional QRS worldwide patent. Gauss meters that measure electrosmog will show no change in power by measuring a QRS Signal because the QRS is the only PEMF system that has this patented built in "Electrosmog Neutralizer."

								 Relax Program: 0.3Hz, 1.5Hz, 3.0Hz dominant frequencies present 3.0Hz through 1000Hz subtly underlying the other frequencies. These frequencies focus on activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This program will positively influence deep relaxation, immune system stimulation, insomnia, and stress reduction as well as red blood cell support for oxygen transport.
							 </p><br>
							 <p>
								 Basis Program: 3Hz, 22Hz, 500Hz, 750Hz, 1000Hz dominant frequencies present, 1000Hz through 10,000Hz subtly underlying the other frequencies. The Basis program focuses on ion-transport, especially protons into the cells, thus stimulating cell metabolism & cellular communication. Red blood cell separation is also stimulated.
							 </p><br>
							 <p>
								 Vital Program: 0.1 Hz, 10Hz, 22Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 750Hz Dominant frequencies present, 750Hz through 10,000Hz subtly underlying the other frequencies. The Vital program is very similar to the Basis program, this program positively influences vitality. These frequencies focus on activation of nitric oxide and oxygen to blood, tissues and cells. Nitric Oxide, is a oxygen carrier molecule and was awarded a Nobel Prize for it's importance in cardiovascular health.
